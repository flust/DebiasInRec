# CausE

Python code for the RecSys 2018 paper entitled 'Causal Embeddings for Recommendation' using Tensorflow. A pre-print version of the paper can be found here - https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07639


## Code Organisation
The code is organized as follows:
- **causal_prod2vec.py** - Used to run the CausE-avg method from the paper, where users response under the uniform exposure is averaged into a single vector.
- **causal_prod2vec2i.py** - Used to run the CausE-prod-T and CausE-prod-C methods from the paper, where users response under the uniform exposure is mapped into a separate product matrix.
- **models.py** - SupervisedProd2Vec and CausalProd2Vec as tensorflow model classes.
- **dataset_loading.py** - File to load Movielens/Netflix datasets and convert to user/product matrix.
- **utils.py** - Various helper methods.

## Dependencies and Requirements
The code has been designed to support python 3.6+ only. The project has the following dependences and version requirements:

- python3 - 3.6.5+
- tensorflow - 1.9.0+
- tensorboard - 1.9.0+
- numpy - 1.14.5+
- scipy - 1.1+
- pandas - 0.22+

## Training a Model

After the data has been downloaded, preprocessed and placed in the Data directory, the models can then be training simply by running **python3 causal_prod2vec.py** or **python3 causal_prod2vec2i.py** from the src directory. The various hyper-parameters of the models can be controlled via arguments detailed below. 

### Optional arguments

The code uses TF flags to manage the command line arguments for running the models, please note that both models have the same parameters.
